## Brief Introduction 

Fine-tuning pre-trained general large language models (LLMs) on a smaller dataset of labeled data specific to a particular task allows the models to learn the specific features that are important for that task, thus improving its performance.

This project focuses on fine-tuning an open-source general LLM, such as Llama 2 or ChatGLM 3, to specialize it in generating technical standards documents.
